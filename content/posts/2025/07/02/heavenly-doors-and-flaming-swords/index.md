Periodically, I contemplate a thought from the book "We Who Wrestle with God" by Jordan B. Peterson, which suggests that at the gates of Heaven, we are met by a flaming sword that will burn away everything unworthy of Heaven, everything imperfect. He also discusses how, in life, we encounter these flaming swords in the form of people who are so much better than us that we feel uncomfortable being around them. We avert our eyes from them and avoid them like the blazing sun, or we try to extinguish their light, for example, through criticism, devaluation, and even scheming.

In the context of this idea, it's interesting to observe our own reactions to certain people and analyze what lies behind these reactions. Here is envy, here is a reminder of failures, here is a reminder of weaknesses, here is a sense of a vast gap in strength of spirit. And it seems all of this is accompanied by a feeling of internal constriction and resentment, although it could be associated with the aspiration to achieve more and become better. This requires accepting one's own imperfections, which is valuable in itself, but also makes being near the ideal less scorching. Perhaps if you have never felt this way, you are already pure enough inside.

Another thought also comes to mind: by default, people try to bring others to their level. A drug addict will give you your first dose, an alcoholic will coax you to drink with them, an expert in their field will share secrets, a good friend will bring a bit of warmth. Some try to eliminate the gap so they don't look too bad compared to you, while others pull you into the light. The main thing here is not to become someone who drags others down, which, again, is more related to your choice not to pull others down, rather than your position being higher or lower.

Just thoughts aloud.

**P.S.**: By the way, Israel can be freely translated as "We Who Wrestle with God."
