Recently, I've often heard that hierarchies are bad, supposedly representing nothing but inequality and oppression. This topic unexpectedly surfaces in seemingly unrelated contexts. I encountered it in a book about startup culture, my children brought it up from school, and there was tension in chats on unrelated topics whenever structures resembling hierarchies were mentioned. On one hand, I agree that some hierarchies can be built on force and suppression. On the other hand, I see them more as symbiotic structures rather than tools for power struggles.

To me, hierarchies are a natural way to allow everyone to engage in what they want and, more importantly, are skilled at doing. It provides an opportunity to delegate tasks to those who can and want to perform them, freeing oneself from tasks that one cannot or does not wish to undertake. In this way, one’s own set of abilities expands through mutually beneficial cooperation with others. In the simplest case, such as in the relationship between an employee and a boss, we can view the boss as a figure of authority, or as someone to whom certain skills are delegated. An ordinary worker often doesn't know where to find money for equipment, how to create a product that consumers want, or how to sell it. Here, the boss steps in, organizing processes while the worker focuses on what they know and can do.

In real life, we encounter not so much strict hierarchies as complex networks of skill delegation, where the boss isn’t always explicitly present or actively involved in forming these connections. For instance, in one of the projects, I borrowed interface design skills from our designer, delegated some work to less experienced engineers, and they, in turn, relied on my experience with operational metrics and building distributed systems in areas where they lacked knowledge. Our product manager delegated implementation, analytics, and subsequent support to us, while we relied on her skills in forming the product vision. Everyone engaged in what they do best.

Similarly, we can think about the organization of family and household life. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and we can work together with our loved ones to cover the areas where we lack skills, abilities, or simply the desire to do something. For example, I usually wash our cars—not because my spouse can't, but because she doesn't want to, and I actually enjoy taking care of the car. Meanwhile, my spouse is much better at planning holidays, and I trust her with that. I rely on her for many other things, and she relies on me. It's a mutually beneficial cooperation.

However, one can also adopt an "exploitation" stance. In this scenario, the product manager "used" the developers to create functionality she couldn't implement herself, dictating what needed to be done. The team leader merely handed out orders, despite not understanding the product and development well or not wanting to be involved. The developers simply followed instructions. Or in our family, we might use each other for personal gain. Many promote this narrative as dominant, citing historical and economic factors. However, it's not the 1900s, and these individuals do not live in a society structured around religious dogmas like modern Afghanistan, so I will leave these arguments aside.

Having experienced both perspectives as dominant views for an extended period, I've noticed that the "exploitation" position is disadvantageous, primarily for its proponent, as it can close even small opportunities for career advancement—how can you grow within a system you disagree with? On the other hand, being grateful for the opportunity to do what you can and having an understanding outlook usually leads to more fruitful results and opens up greater opportunities for personal and professional growth, making you more open to productive collaboration.

In conclusion, while hierarchies are often criticized for fostering inequality, they can also serve as powerful frameworks for collaboration and growth. By recognizing them as dynamic networks of skill delegation, we can harness their potential to enhance individual strengths, encourage mutual support, and drive collective success. Embracing this perspective opens the door to personal and professional development, transforming hierarchies from mere structures of authority into engines of symbiotic advancement.
