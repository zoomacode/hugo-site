## Intro

Another year is coming to an end. People summarize their year and make plans. Reflecting on mine, I once again noticed that books — like many other things we choose and spend time on — tend to reflect who we are at a particular moment in life rather accurately.

This year, that mirror suggests I was more concerned with people and personal development than with technology. Perhaps that’s self-deception, or a way of avoiding other topics. It doesn’t really matter. Books are just books.

## 0. The Gospels

I approached reading the Gospels with the assumption that, over centuries, the text has been refined to a highly condensed form, with no accidental phrasing left in it. Read this way, the Gospels feel less like a historical narrative and more like a practical manual: if a meaning does not reveal itself immediately, it likely requires time, reflection, and observation of one’s own life.

As a result, the reading was slow and fragmented. Many ideas demanded pauses and practical testing.

In this practical reading, the text repeatedly returns to responsibility, ego, forgiveness, and service. Most life outcomes appear as direct consequences of one’s own choices, while avoiding responsibility almost always increases the future cost of mistakes. Forgiveness — of oneself and of others — works not as a moral obligation, but as a way of clearing the path forward. Ego, meanwhile, emerges as the primary source of distortion: it justifies actions, reacts painfully to perceived loss of status, and prevents seeing others clearly.

## 1. The 48 Laws of Power (Robert Greene)

This book reads as a collection of separate rules, each accompanied by a historical anecdote or illustration. The laws do not form a unified theory and do not require linear reading. Instead, the book works as a reference of observations about human behavior within hierarchies — at courts, in organizations, and around power in a broad sense.

The rules are highly practical and consistently rely on recurring human reactions: fear of losing status, desire for recognition, and sensitivity to symbolic gestures.

Here, “power” does not appear as a separate domain, but as a byproduct of social interaction. Many laws describe not what to do, but what to take into account: others’ expectations, their vulnerabilities, and their interpretations of events. Demonstrating intellectual superiority in front of a superior or their circle may be perceived not as contribution, but as a threat. Disappearing from view may be read as loss of relevance, even if nothing has formally changed.

The book does not try to be moral or educational. The laws are presented as descriptions of how people often behave in reality, not as prescriptions that must be followed. They can be read as a catalog of risks and recurring scenarios — where conflicts arise, why they escalate, and which signals others tend to pick up on. In that sense, the book functions more as a tool for increasing awareness of social dynamics than as a guide to acquiring power.

## 2. A Brief History of Intelligence (Max Solomon Bennett)

The book traces a continuous line of the evolution of intelligence — from the simplest life forms to humans — without sharp jumps or a “miracle” of consciousness suddenly appearing. It begins with elementary control mechanisms in microorganisms: basic steering, food-seeking, and responses to favorable or unfavorable conditions.

These basic schemes gradually become more complex, but the underlying logic remains the same. There are states in which a system explores its environment, and states in which it conserves resources or responds to threats. Modern human modes of stress, motivation, and calm are presented as direct descendants of these ancient mechanisms.

The author then turns to the brain as a computational system. The cerebral cortex is described as a collection of unified modules: regions are not inherently specialized, but differ primarily by the type of input they receive. Visual, auditory, and language areas are built from the same repeating blocks.

This idea naturally connects to modern neural networks: some parts generate predictions, others compare them with reality. Prediction error becomes the key signal — the “surprise” we experience when we stumble or encounter an unexpected outcome.

Another important thread is the idea that the brain is constantly predicting and, in a sense, continuously hallucinating, while sensory input merely corrects these hypotheses. When input is reduced or removed, predictions begin to unfold on their own. This model closely aligns with generative approaches in AI — from GANs to diffusion models.

Taken together, the book forms a coherent picture: intelligence is not a separate module, but an evolutionary way of control that helps explain bacterial behavior, brain architecture, and modern artificial systems alike.

## 3. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck (Mark Manson)

The core idea of the book is that we don’t worry too much — we worry about too many things. As a result, we fail to develop a clear core of what actually matters.

The book suggests starting by honestly deciding what is truly important and focusing on that. From there, it gradually moves to a less comfortable idea: our tendency to think of ourselves as exceptional or special.

Instead, the author proposes accepting that most of us are fairly ordinary. Paradoxically, this is an advantage. Growth is easier from the middle. Accepting one’s “average” nature reduces disappointment when things fail and encourages greater effort, precisely because success is not assumed.

Over time, you stop being average and arrive there with a sense that the result was earned. And if circumstances push you back, there is confidence that you can rise again — because you have already done it once.

## 4. Game Theory (Brian Clegg)

The book explains the core ideas of game theory in accessible language, with little mathematics and many real-world examples — from the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Britain’s loss of credibility after failing to carry out its threats.

The narrative revolves around the idea that a single game may have no clear winner or optimal strategy, but when life is viewed as a sequence of games, a winning strategy emerges over time.

Take the game of “chicken,” where two cars drive toward each other and the first to swerve loses. In the short term, swerving early can be rational. In the long term, consistently swerving builds a reputation for being easy to pressure. Refusing to swerve builds the opposite reputation — someone who goes to the end, keeps their word, and follows through on warnings.

“Chicken” is just one of many games we play. While game theory is often applied to politics, it also works in everyday life — including parenting. If someone manages to push you once, they are likely to try again.

## 5. The Art of Seduction (Robert Greene)

This book can be seen as a complement to _The 48 Laws of Power_, but with a focus on relationships with individuals or groups. It outlines several generalized styles of seduction, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

The main approaches revolve around careful study of one’s target and forms of service toward them. At the same time, the book emphasizes that excessive availability and helpfulness can devalue you in the other person’s eyes. More manipulative techniques — such as abrupt mood shifts or initiating conflict — are also described, without justification or condemnation.

## 6. The Anxious Generation (Jonathan Haidt)

The book examines how the internet, and later smartphones and social media, have affected adolescents and older generations. The narrative is supported by research, statistics, and real-life stories.

Different perspectives are explored: from overprotection and “safe” playgrounds that reduce decision-making ability, to the impact of online education and homework on different social groups. The book is likely useful for both parents and schools.

## 7. Beyond Order (Jordan Peterson)

In this continuation of _12 Rules for Life_, the focus shifts from imposing order to learning how to coexist with disorder and understanding its role in life and society.

Chaos is described not primarily as a destructive force, but as a space for exploring what is possible — specifically at the boundaries. Chaos at the center of a system, however, is destructive. In this sense, evolution is contrasted with abrupt revolutionary change.

## 8. We Who Wrestle with God (Jordan Peterson)

In this book, Peterson explores the Old Testament through religious, philosophical, and social lenses. Personal responsibility and sin as self-destruction are central themes.

The story of Cain is examined as an example of how resentment toward God can become a justification for one’s own failures. That resentment prevents recognizing one’s role in events. Pride occupies a central place as the source from which other sins emerge.

## 9. Ego Is the Enemy (Ryan Holiday)

As the title suggests, the book focuses on how ego gets in the way — through certainty in one’s own correctness or inability to see personal mistakes.

For me, it served as a reminder to think before speaking, especially when there is a habit of immediately pointing out others’ errors. By placing ourselves at the center, we often stop moving forward, trying instead to pull everything toward us.

## 10. Meditations (Marcus Aurelius)

For me, this book often felt like a retelling of biblical ideas about personal responsibility for one’s future.

Marcus Aurelius repeatedly returns to simple principles: do what is within your power; don’t complain; the gods have given you everything you need; there is no past or future, only the present; people are what they are and should be accepted as such. Christianity is mentioned somewhat dismissively for its religious form, but the underlying ideas are not criticized.

## 11. Cues (Vanessa Van Edwards)

Vanessa Van Edwards writes about the nonverbal side of communication — eye contact, pauses, posture, and movement. These are signals we often read intuitively, yet they transmit a large portion of information directly to the subconscious.

The book made it easier to notice when a conversation should end and when someone is genuinely engaged. Help with communication is rarely unnecessary.

## 12. The Next Conversation (Jefferson Fisher)

This book presents a collection of ideas about active listening, supported by the author’s personal stories. The core thesis is to truly understand the other person before engaging with their objections.

In some cases, this removes tension and the feeling of “you’re not listening to me.” In others, it reveals that an initial objection is rooted in a deeper conflict. The book overlaps significantly with others on this list.

## 13. Dopamine Nation (Anna Lembke)

Recommended via _The Anxious Generation_, this book explores how positive and negative motivation mechanisms work in the brain.

In simplified terms, the brain tries to maintain balance between pleasure and pain. When one side dominates for too long, the system compensates — either by pushing the opposite side or by reducing sensitivity to the dominant stimulus. This can lead to low mood or loss of motivation under excess pleasure — and the same logic applies in reverse.

Recent research is also revisiting ideas of partial pain relief and even therapeutic use of discomfort. The body perceives “pain” differently from conscious experience: physical exercise, for instance, is stress even if it doesn’t feel painful. Cells need recovery, and the brain needs to rebalance the scales using reward hormones.

## 14. Never Split the Difference (Chris Voss)

A former FBI negotiator describes negotiation through real cases from his career. Significant emphasis is placed on pauses, open-ended questions, and listening before trying to be heard.

This approach reduces anxiety and builds trust. Instead of compromises that satisfy no one, the book offers ways to find solutions with better outcomes — sometimes for both sides, at least for you. While reading _The Art of the Deal_, I often recognized these techniques in action. Several other books on the list could be skipped in favor of this one.

## 15. The Prince (Niccolò Machiavelli)

A classic work on political struggle, difficult to read due to its dense historical references. Still, the general meaning is clear.

If _The 48 Laws of Power_ has already been read, _The Prince_ may be unnecessary. Despite its reputation as a manual of political cruelty and manipulation, it felt more like a pragmatic description of human behavior under competition for resources — with conclusions that apply beyond politics.

While reading, I thought about the story of Moses suppressing rebellion; about _Beyond Order_ and the idea that chaos can exist only at the boundary of a system, otherwise it destroys its center; about how some Native American tribes would completely eliminate defeated enemies; about the wholesale replacement of government during presidential transitions. In all these cases, the same logic appears: preserving the whole sometimes requires radical and unpleasant decisions.

## 16. The Courage to Be Disliked (Ichiro Kishimi, Fumitake Koga)

An introduction to Adlerian psychology presented as a dialogue between a philosopher and a young interlocutor. The format is essential: theory unfolds through objections, questions, and gradual clarification. In audio form, it feels especially natural — like a live conversation.

The key idea is rejecting explanations of behavior based on past trauma. Any behavior is viewed as goal-directed, even when the goal is unclear or destructive. Fears and self-limitations are interpreted as ways of avoiding responsibility or conflict.

The book also introduces the concept of “tasks” and clear separation of responsibility. A task belongs to whoever receives the result. Homework is the student’s task, not the parent’s; work is the worker’s task. Help is possible, but replacing responsibility is not. In this sense, the book echoes both biblical parables and Stoic philosophy.

## 17. On Democracies and Death Cults (Douglas Murray)

The book was initially purchased as immersion in British English — the author has a rich vocabulary and a distinctive style. That interest quickly gave way to the content itself.

The book details the events of October 7, 2023 — the Hamas attack on Israel, its aftermath, and reactions in the West. It contains many firsthand accounts and descriptions of consequences. The text is heavy due to the volume of detail, but I do not regret reading it.

## 18. The Concrete Mixer (Ray Bradbury)

A short story about Martians attempting to conquer Earth, only to be defeated by earthly pleasures.

It prompted thoughts about overconsumption, Sparta, and China. There is a view that Sparta’s decline was partly driven by the influx of gold after the Peloponnesian War. China, meanwhile, repeatedly absorbed its conquerors, turning them into ordinary administrators. A cautionary story.

## 19. Trump: The Art of the Deal (Donald Trump)

Like many books on this list, it was consumed in audio form, with a narrator closely mimicking the author’s intonation, which added to the experience.

The book is more autobiographical than instructional, but it provides enough context to understand decision-making logic. I did not see either a political genius or pure evil here — rather, a person who worked hard, compromised where it didn’t matter, and held the line where it did.

Reading it, I frequently thought of _Never Split the Difference_ and _Game Theory_. I was glad to encounter _The Art of the Deal_ after those books.

## 20. Supercommunicators (Charles Duhigg)

The book focuses on practical mechanisms of effective communication. Its central idea is that “supercommunicators” are not necessarily charismatic, but people who ask questions, involve others, and create a feeling of being truly heard.

After reading, it became easier to notice these patterns at work. In most teams, there are a few people who consistently engage others and frame questions around experience and feelings rather than direct demands. At the same time, the book sometimes loses focus — strong practical chapters sit alongside long social digressions that could be shortened without losing substance.

## Conclusion

When I started writing this piece, I thought I had mostly been reading about people. Now it feels like I was reading about my own mistakes.

It was an interesting year of books. I’m curious what the next one will look like.
