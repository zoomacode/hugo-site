It is interesting to observe that any endeavor where attention is one of key metrics or key drivers.
Regardless of the company size end up in the same hell pit of attention craving and optimization for
it. Even small single person blogs that teach us to be a better person, engineer, or somethings
are prone to that. Many of them, those I used, slowly became "Energy Vampires" to me constantly
seeking for my attention.

Before we continue let's define what "energy vampire" is:

> An “energy vampire” is a person who leaves you feeling depleted both emotionally and mentally after you’ve spent time with them. It’s not a clinical term, but more a colloquial shorthand used to describe a kind of person who drains your energy. And it’s not quite as mysterious as it sounds.

From [calm.com](https://www.calm.com/blog/energy-vampire). There is also a nice list
of energy vampire traits, and symptoms of an exposure to a such creature including
"avoiding social contact" and "Overwhelmed by negativity" and how to deal with them.
