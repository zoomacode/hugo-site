_Amazon is famous for its writing culture which I discovered later in my career. The more I wrote the easier it was to apply the similar approach to other aspects of software development._

**Introduction**

When I joined Amazon, I transitioned from a company with a markedly different culture, particularly in writing and development processes. Initially, my feelings toward Amazon's writing-centric culture were skeptical. However, over the next seven years, I gradually embraced and excelled in the Amazon style of writing.

**Embracing the Customer-Centric Approach**

Amazon's writing culture emphasizes starting with the customer. Whether it's a user story, a narrative, or a press release, the focus is always on the customer's needs. Documents typically progress from the customer perspective to requirements, context, and high-level details, eventually leading to a high-level design. This approach ensures a clear path from customer needs to implementation.

**Transformation of My Mental Model**

My transformation began with the realization that removing technical details from requirements allowed for greater flexibility in the design stage. This shift enabled me to explore a broader variety of options and reconsider my initial ideas. As a result, my designs improved with each iteration, becoming more refined and effective.

**Questioning Assumptions**

I started to question the problem statements of designs, delving into the details of user experience. Questions like "Is this really a problem?" and "Are we addressing the perceived problem or the underlying issue?" helped me develop better user stories and requirements. This approach of questioning assumptions extended beyond documents to influence my overall problem-solving strategy.

**Rethinking Best Practices**

I began to scrutinize best practices and industry standards, especially when the problem was not clearly articulated. Instead of blindly following trends like implementing Scrum, I started asking critical questions such as "What problem are we trying to solve?" and "Is this sustainable?" This mindset shift led to a more cautious approach to our processes and a focus on what truly mattered for our team.

**Adapting Processes to Our Needs**

As a result of these mental changes, my current and former teams have adopted a lighter approach than traditional agile or lean development practices. For instance, we switched from Scrum to Kanban to prioritize steady progress over detailed planning, which better suited the experimental nature of our work.

**Conclusion**

In summary, starting with the customer, questioning assumptions, and thinking independently are key principles that have guided my professional development. These practices have helped me focus on what's important and adapt to the evolving needs of my team and projects.

**A Note on Skepticism**

Lastly, I've noticed that bold statements often trigger a healthy skepticism in me, leading to a series of probing questions. This habit has proven beneficial, as it encourages either the rejection of flawed ideas, the improvement of initial concepts, or the strengthening of arguments through robust defense.

By applying these principles, I've not only improved my writing and design skills but also developed a more critical and adaptable approach to problem-solving in my professional journey at Amazon.
