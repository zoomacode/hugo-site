I’m not an expert in Japanese phonetics just love to learn new things like …. you know Japanese. So it is just how I perceive the language. Also everything is simplified to the level when it can be understood by everyone.

There are two types of adjectives in Japanese: i-adjectives and na-adjectives. The types are named by the sound which connects an adjective and a noun. These two types are interesting because they conjugate differently. Na-ones act more like nouns and i-adjective have their own way.

I-adjective example: _kawaii neko_ (a cute cat) → present and future: _kawaii neko desu_ → negative present and future: _kawaikunai neko desu_ (not a cute cat)→ past: _kawaikatta neko desu_ (was a cure cat) → negative past: _kawaikunakatta neko desu_ (wasn’t a cure cat). The _desu_ part is important, it is an auxiliary part, an equivalent of “to be“ in English, which as we can see does not change but the adjective changes.
Now let have a look at a polite form of na-adjectives: _majime neko_ (serious) → present and future: _majimena neko desu_ (it is serious) → negative present and future: _majimena neko dewa arimasen_ (it is not serious) → past: majimena neko deshita (it was serious) → negative past: _majimena neko dewa arimasen deshi_ (serious). Now only the auxiliary verb changes like it would for nouns.
It was the intro part now the interesting part. There are na-adjectives that look like i-adjectives in their written form for example _kirei_ (clean). However, that i disappears in pronunciation. Depends on how your prior experience you may perceive that last i as e or like y in York. The expert say that it is actually e sound and I’m not one of them.
That is all folks. See you.
