# Feature Boosting in Search Ranking for RAG Applications: Online vs Offline Approaches

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on a search engine component to retrieve relevant documents as grounding for the generative model. Often, business requirements lead teams to **manually boost certain features** in the ranking – for example, multiplying a document’s relevance score by a constant if it has a desired attribute. While this can promote business-critical content, it introduces maintenance overhead and potential bias. In this report, we compare **online (inference-time) feature boosting** methods against **offline (training-time) feature boosting** strategies, and discuss alternatives that incorporate business objectives directly into the model. We evaluate each approach on implementation complexity, flexibility, interpretability, overfitting risk, and production suitability. We also explore how to move beyond manual boosts by using data-driven and end-to-end techniques that optimize business KPIs. The goal is to highlight simple, generalizable, production-ready practices for improving search ranking in RAG and similar applications.

## Online (Inference-Time) Feature Boosting Methods

Online boosting methods adjust document scores at query/inference time, usually via explicit rules or formulas applied after the base ranking model (or retrieval algorithm) computes a relevance score. These methods do **not require retraining** the model; instead, they modify scores on the fly based on certain feature values or business rules.

([How to Optimize Search Relevance: Boosting and Filtering - Enterprise Knowledge](https://enterprise-knowledge.com/how-to-optimize-search-relevance-boosting-and-filtering/)) _Conceptual illustration of boosting and filtering documents. In practice, boosting at query time modifies a document’s score (e.g., via a multiplier or an additive factor) to promote or demote results meeting specific criteria._

### Multiplicative Score Adjustments

One common approach is multiplying the model’s score by a factor if a document has a particular property. Many search engines support this via “boost” parameters or scoring scripts. For example, in Solr/Elasticsearch a query can include field-specific boosts like `title^10` to weight title matches 10× higher than other fields ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Multi_match%20query)). Multiplicative boosts scale a document’s base relevance score by a constant factor, making them **relative** adjustments that preserve the score distribution shape ([The DisMax Query Parser | Apache Solr Reference Guide 8.4](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_4/the-dismax-query-parser.html#:~:text=,document%20by%20a%20relative%20amount)). Key considerations for this method include:

-   **Implementation Complexity:** **Low.** It is straightforward to implement – often just a configuration or one line of code. Most search frameworks have built-in support (e.g. Solr’s `boost` query parser for multiplicative boosts ([The DisMax Query Parser | Apache Solr Reference Guide 8.4](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_4/the-dismax-query-parser.html#:~:text=,document%20by%20a%20relative%20amount))). Even without built-in support, applying a multiplier to the model’s output is trivial at inference time. There’s no need to retrain models or modify indexing pipelines.
-   **Flexibility & Generalizability:** **Limited flexibility.** Multiplicative boosting is easy to tweak per feature, but each boost is a manual, hard-coded rule. It’s **query-independent** (the same factor applies globally, unless you add logic per query type) and doesn’t generalize to new features or changing data patterns without manual intervention. You can adjust the boost values quickly, but introducing a new boosted criterion means writing new code or config. As one search relevance engineer noted, having to hand-tune weights for even a handful of signals can become a “mess” as the number of fields or rules grows ([Learning to Boost — Query-time relevance signal boosting @ Cookpad | by Muhammad Hammad Khan | Source Diving](https://sourcediving.com/learning-to-boost-query-time-relevance-signal-boosting-cookpad-6af9eb206f38#:~:text=Then%20simply%20imagine%20adding%20more,about%20another%2010%20text%20fields)) ([Learning to Boost — Query-time relevance signal boosting @ Cookpad | by Muhammad Hammad Khan | Source Diving](https://sourcediving.com/learning-to-boost-query-time-relevance-signal-boosting-cookpad-6af9eb206f38#:~:text=But%20even%20if%20you%E2%80%99re%20not,results%20are%20the%20most%20relevant)). In RAG systems, for example, you might boost documents from a trusted source by 1.5× – this works across all queries but won’t automatically adjust if the source’s importance changes over time.
-   **Impact on Model Interpretability:** **High interpretability.** The boosting factors are explicit and human-chosen, so it’s very clear why a document’s score was scaled. This transparency is a benefit – stakeholders can understand that _“if feature X is present, we multiply score by Y.”_ The influence on ranking is predictable for any single rule: a multiplicative boost acts as a **scaling factor** on the score, increasing or decreasing it by a fixed percentage ([The DisMax Query Parser | Apache Solr Reference Guide 8.4](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_4/the-dismax-query-parser.html#:~:text=,document%20by%20a%20relative%20amount)). Because it’s relative to the original score, it maintains the ordering among boosted items unless the boost is strong enough to leapfrog other items. Compared to additive boosts, multiplicative ones are generally _more predictable_ across different queries, since they don’t depend on the absolute score magnitudes (which can vary by query) ([The DisMax Query Parser | Apache Solr Reference Guide 8.4](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_4/the-dismax-query-parser.html#:~:text=Generally%20speaking%2C%20using%20,IDF%2C%20average%20field%20length%2C%20etc)) ([The DisMax Query Parser | Apache Solr Reference Guide 8.4](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_4/the-dismax-query-parser.html#:~:text=,document%20by%20a%20relative%20amount)). This predictability aids interpretability.
-   **Risk of Overfitting or Bias:** **High risk of bias.** Manual boosts encode assumptions that may not hold universally. There is a danger of **overemphasizing a feature** without evidence from data. For instance, boosting “newer documents” might improve freshness but could systematically bury older yet highly relevant content (a form of bias). Because these boosts aren’t learned from user behavior, they can misalign with what users actually find relevant. Tuning the boost value is essentially guesswork – too large a boost “can miss the mark of your user’s search,” while too small a boost may have negligible effect ([How to Optimize Search Relevance: Boosting and Filtering - Enterprise Knowledge](https://enterprise-knowledge.com/how-to-optimize-search-relevance-boosting-and-filtering/#:~:text=documents%20as%20more%20relevant%20than,effect%20of%20having%20a%20boost)). It often requires iterative A/B testing to find a reasonable value. Moreover, a static boost can cause _seasonality or context issues_ – e.g., a boost that’s optimal during one season or for one segment of queries might degrade relevance in others ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=Tuning%20per,creates%20more%20questions%20than%20answers)) ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=In%20this%20article%2C%20we%20discuss,another%20perspective%20on%20this%20problem)). In summary, these methods risk introducing **systematic bias** favoring the boosted feature at the expense of relevance, if not carefully calibrated.
-   **Suitability for Production-Scale Systems:** **Generally good, with some caveats.** Because it’s simple and adds minimal compute (just a multiplication), this approach is **fast at query time** and scales to large corpora. In a single-stage ranking pipeline (common in production search), you can afford to apply a few lightweight boosts even while scoring millions of documents ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=,not%20a%20good%20fit%20yet)). Many enterprise search systems use query-time boosts in scoring profiles to align results with business goals ([RAG and generative AI - Azure AI Search | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview#:~:text=match%20at%20L311%20,field%20or%20on%20other%20criteria)). However, maintainability becomes a concern as the number of boosts grows – a lot of manual rules can become technical debt ([How to Optimize Search Relevance: Boosting and Filtering - Enterprise Knowledge](https://enterprise-knowledge.com/how-to-optimize-search-relevance-boosting-and-filtering/#:~:text=competing%20priorities%20of%20what%20information,needs%20into%20a%20uniform%20strategy)) ([How to Optimize Search Relevance: Boosting and Filtering - Enterprise Knowledge](https://enterprise-knowledge.com/how-to-optimize-search-relevance-boosting-and-filtering/#:~:text=documents%20as%20more%20relevant%20than,effect%20of%20having%20a%20boost)). In production, teams often start with such boosts for quick wins but plan to replace or refine them with learned models over time. It’s also worth noting that multiplicative boosts are **static once deployed** – updating them requires a config change or code deployment (though not a re-index or retraining, which is a plus).

### Rule-Based Scoring Layers

Another inference-time approach is to introduce a rule-based layer on top of the model’s scores. This could be as simple as “if document has feature X, add a bonus of N points to its score” or more complex business rules that reorder results (e.g., always place at least one item of category Y in the top 5). Unlike the pure multiplicative factor (which is typically a constant scalar), rule-based scoring can involve conditional logic and different types of adjustments (additive, multiplicative, or even outright positional rules like pinning results). These rules are often implemented in code after retrieving initial results, or via search engine plugins that support custom scripting.

-   **Implementation Complexity:** **Moderate.** Simple rules (like an additive boost) are nearly as easy as multiplicative factors, especially if the search engine supports a “script score” or a scoring plugin. For example, OpenSearch/Elasticsearch allows a painless script to adjust scores based on document fields ([Boosts: Ranking vs. Rules - SearchStax Help Center](https://www.searchstax.com/docs/hc/boosts-ranking-vs-rules/#:~:text=Boosts%3A%20Ranking%20vs.%20Rules%20,a%20partial%20relevance%20score)). However, as you increase the number and complexity of rules, the implementation complexity grows. Ensuring that multiple rules don’t conflict and maintaining the rule engine can become cumbersome. Each new business rule must be coded and tested. If rules interact (for instance, one boosts on feature X, another demotes on feature Y), the combined effect on ranking can be hard to reason about, requiring careful ordering or weighting of rules. In essence, a few simple boosting rules are easy, but a full rule-based layer with many conditions starts to resemble writing a custom ranking algorithm by hand – which is time-consuming and error-prone ([Our Transition to Machine Learning in Search Ranking to Match Customers and Professionals | by Thumbtack Engineering | Thumbtack Engineering | Medium](https://medium.com/thumbtack-engineering/our-transition-to-machine-learning-in-search-ranking-to-match-customers-and-professionals-68fb29e39899#:~:text=Adding%20new%20features%20to%20this,rigorous%20as%20we%20would%20like)).
-   **Flexibility & Generalizability:** **High flexibility in specifics, low in learning.** Rule-based systems are flexible in that you can encode virtually any business logic you want (even non-linear or boolean conditions). They are not limited to linear scalar multiplication. This can cover use cases like _“if user is premium, boost documents with discount offers,”_ etc. However, this flexibility is _manual_ rather than learned – the system doesn’t generalize beyond what you explicitly program. It won’t adapt to changes in user behavior automatically. So while you can address many scenarios, each is a one-off solution. There is also a lack of generalization to unseen scenarios; if a new pattern emerges in the data (say a new type of content becomes important), the rule layer won’t capture it without human intervention. Thus, flexibility in rule design is high, but generalizability of the ranking solution remains limited.
-   **Impact on Model Interpretability:** **High.** Like other manual boosts, rule-based adjustments are human-readable. In fact, they often make ranking decisions _more_ interpretable to business stakeholders: you can explain that _“documents of type X get a +N score boost”_ or _“we explicitly sort all results by revenue potential and then by relevance”_ in a post-processing step. This clarity is a major reason teams implement business rules. The entire ranking pipeline’s logic is spelled out. However, interpretability can suffer if many rules overlap – it may become hard to trace which rule had the dominant effect on a particular result’s position. In practice, careful documentation of the rule set is needed so one can audit why a given search result was ranked in a certain way. As long as the rule set remains reasonably small and straightforward, interpretability is strong.
-   **Risk of Overfitting or Bias:** **High.** Rule-based boosts carry a significant risk of injecting bias, because they directly encode preferences that might not align with user intent. For example, a rule that boosts products with higher profit margins could degrade the user experience if those products aren’t actually more relevant to the query. These methods often _optimize for business metrics at the potential expense of relevance_, unless the rules are crafted very carefully. Since rules don’t learn from data, they can overfit to the assumptions of whoever designed them. Moreover, if the underlying data changes (user trends shift, inventory changes), the static rules might become counterproductive. There’s also the danger of **cascade effects**: one rule might push certain documents up, causing other relevant documents to be pushed down unjustly, which in turn might prompt adding yet more rules to correct perceived issues. This accumulation can create a fragile system that overfits to past conditions. Rigorous A/B testing and periodic review of each rule’s impact are necessary to mitigate this risk.
-   **Suitability for Production-Scale Systems:** **Varies.** For a small number of simple rules, the impact on query latency and throughput is negligible – production systems routinely apply a few boosts or filters per query (for instance, Azure Cognitive Search supports scoring profiles with boosted fields or functions at query time ([How to Optimize Search Relevance: Boosting and Filtering - Enterprise Knowledge](https://enterprise-knowledge.com/how-to-optimize-search-relevance-boosting-and-filtering/#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20boosting%20involves,to%20tweak%20the%20boost%20value)) ([RAG and generative AI - Azure AI Search | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview#:~:text=match%20at%20L311%20,field%20or%20on%20other%20criteria))). Rule-based layers can be made efficient, especially if they are integrated into the search engine’s scoring logic (written in a fast script or precomputed lookup). The challenge is more about **operational complexity**: managing a rule-based system at scale (with possibly dozens of business stakeholders requesting tweaks) can become a burden. There’s also the question of scalability in maintenance: it’s feasible to handle a handful of rules, but not hundreds of ad-hoc rules without a dedicated relevance engineering process. Some large-scale systems have indeed built rule engines for search, but many are moving away from that model due to maintenance costs ([Our Transition to Machine Learning in Search Ranking to Match Customers and Professionals | by Thumbtack Engineering | Thumbtack Engineering | Medium](https://medium.com/thumbtack-engineering/our-transition-to-machine-learning-in-search-ranking-to-match-customers-and-professionals-68fb29e39899#:~:text=Adding%20new%20features%20to%20this,rigorous%20as%20we%20would%20like)). In summary, from a performance standpoint, online rules are production-friendly if kept simple; from a process standpoint, they can become a bottleneck as the product grows.

**Summary of Online Methods:** Inference-time boosting methods (whether simple multipliers or more complex rules) provide quick and transparent ways to inject business logic into rankings. They are easy to deploy and adjust, making them popular for initial relevance tuning or urgent business needs. However, they require manual tuning and oversight to avoid skewing relevance. Over time, an over-reliance on manual boosts can slow down the ability to improve relevance – as one team transitioning to ML noted, adding new features to a heuristic ranking became _“cumbersome and error prone”_ when each addition required custom analysis and re-weighting of existing signals ([Our Transition to Machine Learning in Search Ranking to Match Customers and Professionals | by Thumbtack Engineering | Thumbtack Engineering | Medium](https://medium.com/thumbtack-engineering/our-transition-to-machine-learning-in-search-ranking-to-match-customers-and-professionals-68fb29e39899#:~:text=into%20a%20particular%20range%20,and%20then%20multiplied%20them%20together)). This is where offline approaches come in, aiming to learn the right weights or biases from data rather than fixing them by hand.

## Offline (Training-Time) Feature Boosting Strategies

Offline boosting strategies incorporate the idea of “boosting” important features _during model training or data preparation_, rather than as after-the-fact adjustments. The core idea is to train the ranking model in such a way that it naturally gives higher scores to items with certain feature values (assuming those align with relevance/business goals). This can be done by weighting features, altering the loss function, or providing bias terms that the model can learn. These methods typically require a learning-to-rank (LTR) setup with training data (e.g. query-document pairs with relevance labels or click feedback). They shift the burden of determining how much to boost a feature from manual tuning into the training procedure.

### Feature Weighting in Model Training

“Feature weighting” here means explicitly emphasizing certain features during training. In practice, this could involve scaling feature values, adding duplicate features to increase their influence, or initializing model weights with a bias towards certain features. For example, if you have a feature indicating the document is from a trusted source, you might multiply that feature’s input value by a large constant in the training data so that the model learns it’s significant. In tree-based ranking models (like LambdaMART), one might ensure the feature is included in splits early by providing it with high importance via data transformation or using techniques like monotonic constraints (to guarantee the model learns a positive correlation with the outcome). Key points:

-   **Implementation Complexity:** **Low to Moderate.** Simple feature weighting (like scaling a feature by 2× or 5× in the input) is trivial to implement and requires no changes to the learning algorithm – it’s a data preprocessing step. This is often done when certain features represent _counts or frequencies_ that need normalization, or when you want to roughly hand-tune importance before training. More sophisticated weighting, like adjusting how the algorithm treats feature gain, might require customizing the training code (e.g., modifying how splits are chosen or how regularization is applied for different features). Overall, it’s easier than designing a custom loss function, but it does require some experimentation to choose the right scaling values. A potential pitfall is that naive scaling can saturate a feature’s effect (e.g., in linear models it directly scales the weight learned). Nevertheless, as a strategy it’s accessible: many teams moving from manual boosts to ML start by ensuring those boosted signals are present as features and maybe scaled up in the training data.
-   **Flexibility & Generalizability:** **Moderate.** Feature weighting can be seen as “baking in” a prior importance, but the model can still adjust around it. If the data strongly contradicts the importance of that feature, a sufficiently flexible model (like an ensemble) might still down-weight it during training. Thus, it’s more generalizable than a hard rule – the model could learn to ignore the feature if it isn’t actually useful for the objective. However, you as the practitioner have preset a bias in the training data. This method is flexible in that it works with any machine learning algorithm (it’s not algorithm-dependent), but it is somewhat imprecise. You’re guiding the model rather than explicitly telling it how to rank. One positive is that if additional features are introduced, the model can still consider them freely; you’re not locking the model’s structure, just nudging it. In effect, it’s a semi-manual, semi-automatic approach: you trust the model to do the right thing, but give it a head start on certain features.
-   **Impact on Model Interpretability:** **Moderate to High.** If the resulting model is simple (say a linear model or a small tree ensemble), you might see directly that the feature has a higher learned weight – interpretability remains fairly high. You can say “the model learned to give feature X a weight of 2.5, which we expected to be important.” However, because the model ultimately decides how to use the feature, its effect isn’t as straightforward as an explicit rule. The interpretability depends on model type: a weighted feature in a linear model is still transparent (weight magnitude indicates influence). In more complex models, you may need to use tools like feature importance or SHAP values to verify the feature is indeed contributing as intended. But at least there’s no opaque post-processing – the ranking score is a direct output of the model’s learned function, which can often be interrogated. In comparison to online boosts, you lose the trivial “multiply by constant” explanation, but you gain a model that might combine signals in non-obvious ways. For stakeholders, you’d explain that the model was trained to consider feature X highly, rather than pointing to a single deterministic adjustment.
-   **Risk of Overfitting or Bias:** **Lower than manual boosting (if done right), but not zero.** By letting the model learn from data, we reduce some arbitrary bias. If feature X truly correlates with relevance or user satisfaction, the training process will adjust its weight appropriately. However, by forcibly weighting the feature, we impose a bias that could cause **model overfitting** if feature X is not generally predictive. Essentially, we might be _fighting the data_. There’s a risk of skewing the model’s focus – for example, scaling up a feature’s value by 10× is like saying “this feature is as important as 10 others,” which might not be true in all contexts, leading the model to fit noise related to that feature. That said, because the model still looks at the actual relevance labels or click data, outright overfitting is controlled by the usual regularization and validation processes. A safer variant is to use _sample weighting_ (weigh training examples where feature X is present more heavily in the loss) rather than scaling the feature itself. This targets the outcome (ensuring those examples are ranked correctly) rather than blindly amplifying the feature. In any case, careful evaluation is needed. The advantage is that biases introduced at training can be detected in offline metrics – e.g., if our boosted feature starts harming NDCG on a holdout set, we’d see it and can dial back. This is harder to catch with manual live boosts except via A/B test. So the risk of unintended bias is present but manageable with offline experimentation.
-   **Suitability for Production-Scale Systems:** **High (once model is trained).** Feature weighting adds virtually no cost at inference – it’s just part of the model’s computation. The heavier lift is on the training side, which might require multiple iterations to get the weighting scheme right. In production, using an ML model that inherently accounts for business features can simplify the serving architecture: you don’t need extra boosting logic at query time, which **reduces system complexity** and chances for errors. Many large-scale search systems use gradient boosted decision trees or neural rankers that take dozens of features (including business signals) as input; once deployed, these models handle the trade-offs internally. Modern ML serving infrastructure (like TensorFlow Ranking, XGBoost, LightGBM or Vespa) can handle these models at scale. For example, the Elasticsearch Learning-to-Rank plugin allows training a LambdaMART model on offline data and then deploys it to re-rank search results, which automates what were formerly manual field boosts ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=The%20Elasticsearch%20Learning%20to%20Rank,field%20%E2%80%9Cmatch%E2%80%9D%20ranking%20features)) ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=Later%20you%20can%20join%20it,LTR)). Such models have been used in production at places like Bing, Yahoo, and e-commerce sites – they’re proven to scale with proper engineering. The main consideration is maintaining an efficient training pipeline and ensuring you have fresh data to retrain on when business priorities shift.

### Loss Function Adjustments (Customized Training Objectives)

This strategy involves modifying the training objective so that the model explicitly learns to boost certain features or outcomes. Instead of (or in addition to) weighting the input features, you shape the loss function to encode your preferences. For instance, you might add a penalty term if the model ranks a document with a desired feature too low. Or you might create a composite loss that mixes standard relevance (say, NDCG loss) with a business metric (like revenue). Essentially, you guide the model with a tailored objective that aligns with both user relevance and business goals.

-   **Implementation Complexity:** **High.** Changing the loss function often requires in-depth knowledge of the learning algorithm and sometimes a custom training framework. While some toolkits (e.g., TensorFlow Ranking) allow plugin losses, you usually need to derive gradients for any custom terms and ensure the loss is balanced/scaled properly. An example would be adding a term: `Loss_total = Loss_relevance + λ * Loss_boost`, where `Loss_boost` could measure how far the model’s ranking is from one that perfectly ranks items with the target feature on top. Tuning the hyperparameter λ is non-trivial – set it too high and you sacrifice relevance for the boost, too low and the effect is negligible. Despite the complexity, this approach precisely injects the business requirement into model training. Some industry applications of multi-objective ranking use this idea; for example, a model might optimize a weighted sum of relevance and conversion probability ([Multi-objective ranking optimization for product search using stochastic label aggregation - Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/publications/multi-objective-ranking-optimization-for-product-search-using-stochastic-label-aggregation#:~:text=Learning%20a%20ranking%20model%20in,this%20work%20we%20explore%20several)). But implementing and validating such a multi-faceted loss requires significant effort and ML expertise.
-   **Flexibility & Generalizability:** **High flexibility (in what you can encode), potentially high generalizability.** You can encode nearly any preference or constraint in a loss function, including global list properties. Once implemented, the model learns to generalize that preference across all queries in an optimal way, based on data. For instance, instead of a blunt rule, you could train the model to softly prefer higher-margin products by giving actual margin value as a part of the loss (thus the model learns _how much_ margin to trade off against relevance depending on context). This is more nuanced and data-driven. The approach is flexible enough to incorporate things like fairness constraints or diversity requirements by adding terms for those (research has done this for fairness in ranking via constrained optimization in the loss). The generalizability comes from the model learning a function that balances objectives for new, unseen queries in a principled way, rather than applying static rules. However, the caveat is that if your custom objective is mispecified (e.g., incorrect weights between objectives), the model will consistently optimize the wrong balance everywhere.
-   **Impact on Model Interpretability:** **Low to Moderate.** Custom loss functions often yield models that are _harder to interpret directly_. The model is optimizing a complex objective, and the resulting relationship between features and the final prediction might not be intuitive. For example, if you mix relevance and business objective in the loss, the model might sacrifice some relevance on certain queries to gain business metric – understanding those trade-offs may require analyzing the model’s decisions or coefficients. If the model is inherently interpretable (like a linear model), you might still read off feature weights, but they now reflect a blend of objectives. Often, interpretability is sacrificed for the sake of improved combined outcomes. This can be mitigated with post-hoc explainability tools or by choosing model forms that are somewhat interpretable (e.g., generalized additive models). Still, compared to a simple multiplier in production, this is opaque: you cannot point to one part of the system and say “here is the boost factor” – it’s diffused into the model’s parameters. For stakeholder trust, it’s important to validate that the model is behaving as intended (for instance, show that it’s ranking high-margin items slightly higher on average, as expected).
-   **Risk of Overfitting or Bias:** **Medium.** On one hand, because the model is trained on real data (including, ideally, user engagement signals), it will not simply overfit a rule regardless of utility – it still must predict well to minimize loss. This can reduce the arbitrary bias. On the other hand, how you design the loss can introduce _systematic bias_. If your loss heavily prioritizes a business metric, the model may end up always favoring that even when it hurts relevance for certain user segments (the model is only as “fair” as the loss you define). Also, if the business objective isn’t carefully aligned with user satisfaction, you risk an overfitting of sorts to business desires at the cost of long-term user metrics. Another risk is complexity: with more complex loss functions, you might overfit the training data if the model tries to optimize strange edges of the multi-objective space. Regularization and validation are key – you need to monitor not just overall loss but each component (does the relevance metric drop too much?). When done properly, however, this approach can _avoid the need for manual post hoc bias_, because the biases (boosts) are learned in a controlled way. For example, Amazon reported success in optimizing for both relevance and purchase likelihood using a stochastic label aggregation approach, effectively teaching the model to rank for multiple objectives without manual biasing ([Multi-objective ranking optimization for product search using stochastic label aggregation - Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/publications/multi-objective-ranking-optimization-for-product-search-using-stochastic-label-aggregation#:~:text=Learning%20a%20ranking%20model%20in,this%20work%20we%20explore%20several)).
-   **Suitability for Production-Scale Systems:** **Medium.** Once trained, the model is like any other and can be deployed (the runtime cost is no different than a normal model of that complexity). The challenge is in the **development cycle**: experimenting with custom losses is time-consuming, and updating the model when business priorities change means revisiting the loss design. Not every team has the capacity to maintain a bespoke training pipeline. In production, you also need to ensure that your training data is regularly updated to reflect current user behavior and business needs – otherwise the model’s learned “boosting” might become stale (similar to how manual boosts can become stale). There have been production systems that successfully use multi-objective ranking models (Airbnb, for instance, optimized search ranking for guest satisfaction and booking rates together ([Multi-objective learning-to-rank in product search - LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/multi-objective-learning-to-rank-product-search-muthusamy-chelliah#:~:text=such%20as%20maximizing%20relevance%20of,retrieved%20products%20wrt%20user%20query)) ([Beyond Relevance: Optimizing for Multiple Objectives in Search and ...](https://www.shaped.ai/blog/beyond-relevance-optimizing-for-multiple-objectives-in-search-and-recommendations#:~:text=Beyond%20Relevance%3A%20Optimizing%20for%20Multiple,It%20assigns%20a%20numerical))), but these typically require robust ML Ops. In summary, if your organization can handle the complexity, this strategy yields a single model that directly optimizes what you care about, simplifying the production serving (no separate rules engine). If not, it might be overkill compared to simpler methods.

### Learning “Bias” or Offsets for Features

“Bias learning” refers to training a model to learn constant adjustments (bias terms) for certain feature values or groups. For example, instead of manually adding +5 to scores of premium documents, you introduce a feature (perhaps one-hot encoded category or source indicator) and let the model assign it a weight during training. In effect, the model learns a bias or intercept specific to that feature. Many ranking models (especially linear or factorization models) can learn per-feature or per-group biases if those are provided as inputs. It’s a more data-driven way to achieve what manual boosting does – the model might learn, say, a +1.2 score bonus for “isNew=Yes” if, historically, new items performed better.

-   **Implementation Complexity:** **Low.** This is typically as easy as adding additional features to the training data. If you want the model to potentially apply a boost for a condition, encode that condition as a binary feature. For instance, add a feature `f_premium` which is 1 for premium documents and 0 otherwise. The model (if it’s sufficiently expressive) will then have a weight for `f_premium`. Training will adjust that weight to maximize the objective. No custom code is needed beyond including the feature and maybe ensuring the model type can represent a bias (most can). In a pairwise or pointwise LTR scenario, this just means an extra column in your feature set. Even for neural models, it could be an extra input neuron or embedding. The model might also learn interaction effects (like premium status matters more for certain query types if given the capacity). Overall, it’s one of the simplest ways to “let the model handle it.”
-   **Flexibility & Generalizability:** **High.** Since the model learns the bias from data, it will generalize that effect to unseen queries and appropriately calibrate the strength. If the effect of a feature differs by context, a sufficiently complex model can even learn a context-dependent bias (e.g., by interacting the feature with query features). Compared to hard-coding an offset, this is far more flexible – the model could essentially decide _not_ to use the bias if it’s not relevant (i.e., weight near zero), or to use it only in combination with other signals. Generalization is also improved because the bias weight is learned from many training examples, effectively averaging the effect of that feature across different situations in an optimal way. In other words, the model might learn “premium source is generally good, but not if the text relevance is very low” implicitly, whereas a manual rule would boost it blindly. The only limitation is that this requires historical data that shows the benefit of that feature (implicit or explicit relevance labels). If the feature is new or rare, the model might not learn an appropriate weight – in such cases, manual boosting is sometimes used as a stopgap until enough data accumulates.
-   **Impact on Model Interpretability:** **Moderate.** If using an interpretable model, the learned bias weight is straightforward: e.g., the model might have a weight of 0.8 for `f_premium` in a linear model, meaning it adds 0.8 to the score if premium. That’s quite interpretable – it’s effectively a learned boost. In tree-based models, one could see that premium documents often end up a bit higher due to splitting on that feature. However, because the model could also use the feature in interactions, it might not be a single global additive factor. Still, relative to arbitrary learned interactions, these bias features tend to enhance interpretability because they isolate a factor of interest. Stakeholders can be told “the model has learned a positive effect for feature X.” Many LTR practitioners actually examine learned weights to validate they make sense (for example, did the model learn to boost more popular items? If yes, and that was expected, it’s a sanity check). One caution: if the model is very complex (like deep neural nets), extracting the notion of a bias might require probing techniques. But for typical ranking models (GBDTs, linear, even shallow neural nets), this is manageable.
-   **Risk of Overfitting or Bias:** **Medium (lower than manual, but depends on data).** The model will only assign a large weight to the bias feature if it truly improves predictive performance on the training data (and by extension, hopefully on validation/test data). So blatant mis-alignments are less likely than with manual boosts. However, if your training data has bias, the model will simply pick it up. For instance, if historically the business pushed premium content to users more often (via past manual boosts), user clicks might skew to those, and the model trained on that data will reinforce the bias. This is a general problem of **learning from feedback loops**. It can be mitigated by techniques from unbiased learning-to-rank (to de-bias click data), or by carefully curating training labels. Overfitting in the sense of the model assigning an unwarranted bias weight could happen if the feature correlates with relevance in the training set by coincidence. That’s why validation and possibly regularization are important (e.g., using a small L1/L2 penalty to avoid over-weighting any single feature without enough evidence). Overall, letting the model learn tends to be less brittle than manual rules – if the effect is spurious, a well-regularized model might keep the weight small. If the effect is real, it will shine through. It’s important to continuously monitor model outcomes to ensure no unfair biases creep in (just as you would monitor manual boosts). The advantage here is you can retrain the model on new data periodically, which may adjust the bias if user behavior changes.
-   **Suitability for Production-Scale Systems:** **High.** This approach essentially integrates seamlessly into a typical ML-based ranking pipeline. You do need the infrastructure for training and deploying models, but assuming that exists, adding features and retraining is part of the normal workflow. Many production systems log new features and retrain models regularly (e.g., Bing search reportedly logs signals and retrains its RankNet/GBDT models frequently). As an example, Thumbtack’s search ranking transitioned to ML and they handle new feature additions by logging them and retraining; once enough data is collected, the model naturally incorporates those features ([Our Transition to Machine Learning in Search Ranking to Match Customers and Professionals | by Thumbtack Engineering | Thumbtack Engineering | Medium](https://medium.com/thumbtack-engineering/our-transition-to-machine-learning-in-search-ranking-to-match-customers-and-professionals-68fb29e39899#:~:text=customer%20contact%20model,from%20other%20sources%20when%20appropriate)). In terms of serving, there is no additional complexity – the model’s scoring function just includes those learned biases. This is highly scalable and efficient at query time (just computing an extra feature weight). One thing to note is that you might still combine this with a two-stage retrieval approach: for instance, use a first-pass retrieval (BM25 or embedding) and then apply a learned model (that includes these feature biases) to rerank top N results. This “learning to re-rank” architecture is common and is production-proven (e.g., the Elasticsearch LTR plugin or Vespa’s ranking framework ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=The%20Elasticsearch%20Learning%20to%20Rank,field%20%E2%80%9Cmatch%E2%80%9D%20ranking%20features)) ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=Almost%20the%20same%20solution%20can,Search%20with%20Learning%20to%20Rank))). It allows heavy feature use on a smaller candidate set. In summary, learning biases for features is a very production-friendly way to replace manual boosts – it requires an upfront ML investment, but yields a maintainable system where adjusting a “boost” is as simple as retraining with updated data or tweaking training weights.

As the table suggests, **online methods excel in simplicity and immediate control**, but at the cost of flexibility and long-term maintainability. **Offline methods require an upfront investment in ML modeling**, but yield solutions that adapt to data and are easier to scale without a proliferation of manual rules. In practice, many production systems use a hybrid: a baseline retrieval with a few light boosts, followed by a learned re-ranker. This takes advantage of the performance of simple boosts for scanning a large corpus, and the accuracy of ML for fine ordering on a smaller set ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=To%20solve%20the%20problem%20of,hybrid%20approach%20of%20shallow%20reranking)) ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=,not%20a%20good%20fit%20yet)).

Next, we discuss alternatives that aim to **avoid manual boosting altogether** by incorporating business signals and constraints directly into the ranking model or pipeline in a more holistic way.

## Beyond Manual Boosting: Integrated Strategies

Instead of maintaining separate boosting logic, an ideal scenario is when the ranking system inherently satisfies business objectives because those objectives are part of what the model optimizes. Here we outline several strategies to achieve that: (1) include business-related signals in the training objective, (2) train end-to-end models to directly optimize business KPIs, and (3) use learning-to-rank or re-ranking methods that enforce global constraints (like diversity or fairness) so that manual rules aren’t needed. These approaches can significantly reduce the need for ongoing manual tweaks.

### Incorporating Business Signals into Training Objectives

One way to remove manual boosts is to make the model care about the same things the business cares about, **at training time**. If you have signals such as item popularity, freshness, or profit margin that you currently boost, you can incorporate them into the model’s labels or objective. For example, if the business goal is to promote higher-margin products _as long as they are relevant_, you could define a reward function that gives a higher relevance score to purchases of high-margin products. Training the model on such a reward would naturally encourage it to rank those items higher. In academic terms, this is a form of **multi-objective learning to rank** or **value-based ranking**.

A practical approach is to use a **weighted label or augmented label**. For instance, if you have implicit feedback like clicks or conversions, you can weight those outcomes by a business value. A click on a premium content item might count as 1.2 “relevance” vs. 1.0 for a click on a regular item. The model trained on these weighted labels will tend to push up premium content automatically. Amazon scientists describe reducing multi-objective ranking to a single-objective problem by combining labels – essentially crafting a single relevance signal that embeds multiple goals ([Multi-objective ranking optimization for product search using stochastic label aggregation - Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/publications/multi-objective-ranking-optimization-for-product-search-using-stochastic-label-aggregation#:~:text=Learning%20a%20ranking%20model%20in,We%20propose%20a%20novel)). They found that stochastic label aggregation (randomly sometimes using one objective’s label and sometimes the other’s during training) can lead to a model that balances objectives effectively ([Multi-objective ranking optimization for product search using stochastic label aggregation - Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/publications/multi-objective-ranking-optimization-for-product-search-using-stochastic-label-aggregation#:~:text=query%2C%20as%20well%20as%20maximizing,We%20provide%20a)).

Another example: if zero-result queries are a big concern (business wants to minimize queries that return nothing), you can incorporate a term in the loss that heavily penalizes failing to retrieve at least one relevant document. This would push the model to err on the side of recall, effectively boosting documents that might be marginal but ensure the user sees something.

Overall, by training on a **blended objective**, the model internalizes the business boosts. This requires that you have a way to quantify the business goal. Many teams use proxy metrics. As mentioned earlier, Thumbtack wanted to rank for completed projects (a downstream KPI), but since that was hard to directly optimize (sparse data), they optimized for a proxy: a “positive response” rate ([Our Transition to Machine Learning in Search Ranking to Match Customers and Professionals | by Thumbtack Engineering | Thumbtack Engineering | Medium](https://medium.com/thumbtack-engineering/our-transition-to-machine-learning-in-search-ranking-to-match-customers-and-professionals-68fb29e39899#:~:text=Before%20specifying%20particular%20machine%20learning,are%20when%20the%20professional%20declines)). They trained models to predict the probability of a match between customer and professional, effectively baking that business success metric into the ranking score ([Our Transition to Machine Learning in Search Ranking to Match Customers and Professionals | by Thumbtack Engineering | Thumbtack Engineering | Medium](https://medium.com/thumbtack-engineering/our-transition-to-machine-learning-in-search-ranking-to-match-customers-and-professionals-68fb29e39899#:~:text=With%20this%20framing%2C%20we%20decided,customer%20and%20professional%20expressing%20interest)) ([Our Transition to Machine Learning in Search Ranking to Match Customers and Professionals | by Thumbtack Engineering | Thumbtack Engineering | Medium](https://medium.com/thumbtack-engineering/our-transition-to-machine-learning-in-search-ranking-to-match-customers-and-professionals-68fb29e39899#:~:text=interest%20in%20the%20job%20if,customer%20and%20professional%20expressing%20interest)). The result was an end-to-end system where the score directly corresponds to the business KPI (likelihood of a successful match), rather than just ad-hoc relevance.

Incorporating signals into training is relatively **production-friendly** once set up: you maintain a consistent model that just has a more complex objective. It also reduces the need for separate experimentation on boosts – you instead experiment with objective weights. This strategy does require careful offline evaluation and often multiple iterations to get the mix right (so the model doesn’t, say, show only high-margin items that no one clicks). But when successful, it aligns model behavior with business metrics in a continuous and data-driven way, **eliminating a lot of manual boost maintenance**.

### End-to-End Ranking Models Optimizing Business KPIs

This goes a step further: rather than incorporating business goals as a tweak to relevance, design the entire ranking model to directly predict or optimize a business KPI. For instance, train a ranking model to maximize revenue per search, or long-term user engagement, or conversion rate – whatever the key performance indicator is. In an end-to-end approach, you might not even have a separate notion of “relevance”; relevance is defined by the KPI.

A classic example would be an e-commerce search engine shifting from optimizing click-through-rate to optimizing purchase rate or revenue. The ranking model could be trained on historical purchase data – given a query and a set of results, did the user end up buying something, and which one? This turns ranking into a direct prediction of purchase likelihood. Any feature (including textual relevance, personalization, etc.) that helps predict purchase will be used. Business features like product price or margin can be included so that the model might indirectly learn about revenue maximization (though one has to be cautious – it might also learn to push expensive items that are less likely to convert, so a balanced approach or multi-objective is often needed).

Some companies have deployed such end-to-end models. For instance, a social network might rank content in a feed by a composite score that represents predicted user engagement and ad revenue generated – essentially one unified model for “value” of an item to the platform ([Beyond Relevance: Optimizing for Multiple Objectives in Search and Recommendations | Shaped Blog](https://www.shaped.ai/blog/beyond-relevance-optimizing-for-multiple-objectives-in-search-and-recommendations#:~:text=,be%20exposed%20to%20relevant%20users)) ([Beyond Relevance: Optimizing for Multiple Objectives in Search and Recommendations | Shaped Blog](https://www.shaped.ai/blog/beyond-relevance-optimizing-for-multiple-objectives-in-search-and-recommendations#:~:text=Value%20Modeling%3A%20A%20Practical%20Approach,Objective%20Optimization)). This concept is sometimes called a **“value model”**: it assigns each candidate a value that combines various objectives, and the model is trained to predict that value ([Beyond Relevance: Optimizing for Multiple Objectives in Search and Recommendations | Shaped Blog](https://www.shaped.ai/blog/beyond-relevance-optimizing-for-multiple-objectives-in-search-and-recommendations#:~:text=Value%20Modeling%3A%20A%20Practical%20Approach,Objective%20Optimization)) ([Beyond Relevance: Optimizing for Multiple Objectives in Search and Recommendations | Shaped Blog](https://www.shaped.ai/blog/beyond-relevance-optimizing-for-multiple-objectives-in-search-and-recommendations#:~:text=Platforms%20like%20Facebook%2C%20Twitter%2C%20YouTube%2C,interaction%20data%2C%20form%20the%20core)). Facebook and Twitter have publicly discussed their use of value models to balance user satisfaction with advertiser objectives ([Beyond Relevance: Optimizing for Multiple Objectives in Search and Recommendations | Shaped Blog](https://www.shaped.ai/blog/beyond-relevance-optimizing-for-multiple-objectives-in-search-and-recommendations#:~:text=Platforms%20like%20Facebook%2C%20Twitter%2C%20YouTube%2C,interaction%20data%2C%20form%20the%20core)).

In search, an end-to-end KPI-optimizing model might use **reinforcement learning or bandit algorithms** if the objective is long-term (because immediate relevance might conflict with long-term metrics). For example, optimizing for lifetime user value might require occasionally showing diverse or exploratory results to gauge interest – a purely myopic relevance model won’t do that. There’s research on using reinforcement learning in search ranking (learning policies that decide which results to show to maximize some reward over time) ([From structured search to learning-to-rank-and-retrieve](https://www.amazon.science/blog/from-structured-search-to-learning-to-rank-and-retrieve#:~:text=From%20structured%20search%20to%20learning,ad%20platforms%2C%20and%20recommender%20systems)) ([From structured search to learning-to-rank-and-retrieve](https://www.amazon.science/blog/from-structured-search-to-learning-to-rank-and-retrieve#:~:text=Using%20reinforcement%20learning%20improves%20candidate,ad%20platforms%2C%20and%20recommender%20systems)), though production use is still emerging due to complexity.

From a **production standpoint**, directly optimizing a business KPI can be challenging because it often requires a lot of data (the signals are sparser) and careful evaluation to ensure you’re not hurting the user experience. It can also entrench biases (if historically certain items got more exposure, the model might keep favoring them). Techniques like exploration (multi-armed bandits in search results) are sometimes used to continue learning and not get stuck in a self-fulfilling loop.

That said, when feasible, this approach can render manual boosts obsolete: the model, by pursuing the KPI, will “discover” the importance of various features on its own. For instance, if fresh content truly drives user engagement (business believes in freshness), a model optimizing engagement should learn to give fresh content higher scores if the data supports it. If it doesn’t, maybe the business assumption needs revisiting. This can lead to more **evidence-based feature influence** rather than intuition-based boosts.

A concrete industry example is how Airbnb improved their search ranking by moving to a multi-objective ML model that considered both guest satisfaction (in terms of booking success and rating) and host preferences, instead of just a heuristic sort order. Their system used model distillation to combine objectives, resulting in a single model optimizing the end-to-end outcome ([Multi-objective learning-to-rank in product search - LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/multi-objective-learning-to-rank-product-search-muthusamy-chelliah#:~:text=such%20as%20maximizing%20relevance%20of,retrieved%20products%20wrt%20user%20query)) ([Multi-objective Learning to Rank by Model Distillation - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07181v1#:~:text=Multi,end%20ranking%20system%20at%20Airbnb)). This eliminated the need for separate sorting rules for things like host acceptance rate because the model inherently accounts for it.

In summary, end-to-end KPI models are the ultimate way to align ranking with business goals. They require investment in data (to get ground truth for the KPI), possibly new algorithms, and continuous monitoring to ensure user metrics aren’t adversely affected. Not every scenario warrants this from the start, but it’s a direction many large-scale search and recommendation systems are moving toward – thereby reducing reliance on manual “knobs” like boosts.

### Learning-to-Re-Rank with Global Constraints

Sometimes the business needs involve **global constraints or diversity goals** that are hard to enforce with a simple per-document score tweak. For example, ensuring that the top 10 results aren’t all from the same category, or that certain groups are fairly represented, or that at least one result is a newly added item. Manual boosting one feature might not guarantee such constraints. Instead, one can employ a _reranking algorithm_ that takes the initial ranked list and rearranges it to satisfy these constraints while staying as true as possible to the model’s scores.

A classic example is **result diversification**. Let’s say users issuing a vague query should see a variety of subtopics. You might have a business rule like “if the top results are too similar, boost some diverse content.” Rather than guessing boost values, an algorithm like **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)** can be used. MMR re-ranks documents by considering both relevance and novelty, selecting documents that add new information ([Re-Ranking with Maximal Marginal Relevance in LangStream](https://langstream.ai/2023/10/04/introducing-mmr-rerank/#:~:text=Re,two%20criteria%3A%20relevance%20and%20diversity)) ([Maximal Marginal Relevance to Re-rank results in Unsupervised KeyPhrase Extraction | by Aditya Kumar | tech-that-works | Medium](https://medium.com/tech-that-works/maximal-marginal-relevance-to-rerank-results-in-unsupervised-keyphrase-extraction-22d95015c7c5#:~:text=Maximal%20Marginal%20Relevance%20a,for%20already%20ranked%20documents%2Fphrases%20etc)). It effectively introduces a diversity constraint: each next document is chosen for high relevance _and_ low redundancy with already-chosen docs ([Maximal Marginal Relevance to Re-rank results in Unsupervised KeyPhrase Extraction | by Aditya Kumar | tech-that-works | Medium](https://medium.com/tech-that-works/maximal-marginal-relevance-to-rerank-results-in-unsupervised-keyphrase-extraction-22d95015c7c5#:~:text=Maximal%20Marginal%20Relevance%20a,for%20already%20ranked%20documents%2Fphrases%20etc)). This kind of reranker ensures a global property (diversity) without manual category boosts. In practice, MMR and its variants are used in search and RAG pipelines to balance relevance with coverage ([Enhancing RAG with Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) in Azure ...](https://farzzy.hashnode.dev/enhancing-rag-with-maximum-marginal-relevance-mmr-in-azure-ai-search#:~:text=Enhancing%20RAG%20with%20Maximum%20Marginal,balance%20both%20relevance%20and%20diversity)).

For fairness or exposure constraints (important in domains like job search or marketplaces), one might use a **constraint solver or linear programming approach** in a reranker. For instance, you can formulate: “select top 10 results such that at least 3 are from category A and at least 3 from category B” as a linear assignment problem. This can be solved optimally given a utility score for each candidate (the base relevance). Tools like Google’s TensorFlow Ranking and research frameworks have explored adding such constraints in post-processing or in the loss function ([[PDF] Fairness for Robust Learning to Rank - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06288#:~:text=,processing)) ([[PDF] Fairness in Ranking, Part II: Learning-to-Rank and Recommender ...](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10352864#:~:text=,incorporating%20a%20notion%20of%20merit)). There are also heuristic greedy algorithms that can enforce rules (e.g., a round-robin selection from different buckets of items).

**Learning-to-rerank** refers to training a second-stage model that looks at a _set of candidates_ and produces a reordering. This second stage can be taught to respect global properties. For example, you could train a reranker that takes as input not just one document at a time, but the context of other top documents, and learn to produce a diversified list. This is a complex research area, but simpler approaches exist. One approach is to generate multiple candidate rankings optimizing different objectives (one for relevance, one for diversity, etc.) and then have a learned model pick or blend them – somewhat like an ensemble that ensures coverage of objectives.

In production, a two-stage setup is common: first stage is recall-focused (maybe using boosted BM25 or vector search), second stage is precision-focused (like a neural ranker) ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=To%20solve%20the%20problem%20of,hybrid%20approach%20of%20shallow%20reranking)). You can incorporate global considerations in the second stage relatively easily when the candidate set is small (e.g., reordering 100 items). For instance, a reranker could incorporate features like “similarity to highest-ranked item so far” to penalize redundancy. Or it might be a simple rule: “inject a recent document in position 5 if none in top 4.” These can be learned or hand-coded. Even when hand-coded, doing it at the rerank stage on top-N results limits the damage and complexity (and can be combined with learning).

**Production suitability:** Global constraint rerankers can be done efficiently if N (rerank depth) is reasonably small. Many search systems already do this with diversification or business rules (e.g., an e-commerce site ensuring different brands in top results). The advantage of a learned or algorithmic reranker is that it uses a principled method rather than a ton of manual boosts for each category or group. As with any complex system, careful testing is needed, but these rerankers can be turned on or off as needed for certain queries (like trigger diversity only for ambiguous queries). In RAG pipelines, an MMR reranker is often applied after retrieving passages to improve the coverage of information provided to the LLM ([azure-ai-search-maximum-marginal-relevance.ipynb - GitHub](https://github.com/farzad528/azure-ai-search-python-playground/blob/main/azure-ai-search-maximum-marginal-relevance.ipynb#:~:text=azure,improve%20the%20quality%20of)) – this avoids having to guess boost values for different knowledge sources by instead explicitly optimizing a diversity-relevance trade-off.

In essence, **learning to re-rank with constraints** allows you to meet business requirements (diversity, fairness, freshness quotas, etc.) in a controlled way, potentially eliminating the need for ad-hoc boosts. It shifts the perspective from “score tweaking” to “list optimization.” As tools and libraries for these techniques mature, they are becoming more accessible (for example, Azure Cognitive Search offers a semantic reranker and the ability to apply something like MMR for diversity ([RAG and generative AI - Azure AI Search | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview#:~:text=match%20at%20L311%20,field%20or%20on%20other%20criteria))). This is an area where business rules and ML meet – one can encode the high-level constraints (which are inherently manual decisions) and let an algorithm figure out the exact reordering to best satisfy them without overly sacrificing relevance ([Maximal Marginal Relevance to Re-rank results in Unsupervised KeyPhrase Extraction | by Aditya Kumar | tech-that-works | Medium](https://medium.com/tech-that-works/maximal-marginal-relevance-to-rerank-results-in-unsupervised-keyphrase-extraction-22d95015c7c5#:~:text=Maximal%20Marginal%20Relevance%20a,for%20already%20ranked%20documents%2Fphrases%20etc)) ([Maximal Marginal Relevance to Re-rank results in Unsupervised KeyPhrase Extraction | by Aditya Kumar | tech-that-works | Medium](https://medium.com/tech-that-works/maximal-marginal-relevance-to-rerank-results-in-unsupervised-keyphrase-extraction-22d95015c7c5#:~:text=phrases%20along%20with%20score,the%20phrases%20for%20that%20document)).

## Conclusion

Business-driven feature boosting in search ranking is often a necessary tactic to align search results with organizational goals. We examined how **online methods** like multiplicative score boosts and rule-based layers are **simple and interpretable**, providing quick control at the expense of manual effort and potential bias. **Offline methods** like feature weighting, custom loss functions, and learned biases integrate those priorities into the model training process, offering more **generalizable and maintainable** solutions – these require an upfront ML investment, but pay off in reduced ongoing tuning and often better overall relevance. Table 1 summarized these trade-offs, highlighting that no one approach is universally best: the choice depends on team resources, data availability, and the complexity of business objectives.

For a team of ML scientists currently using manual score multipliers, a clear path forward is to **gradually move boosts into the model**. Start by logging the boosted features and outcomes, and train a learning-to-rank model (e.g., a gradient boosted tree or neural ranker) that includes those features. This can replicate the effect of boosts in a learned way. As Cookpad’s search team put it, _“using [click] data, you learn values that balance these different signals better than you would as a human trying to balance potentially hundreds of different scores”_ ([Learning to Boost — Query-time relevance signal boosting @ Cookpad | by Muhammad Hammad Khan | Source Diving](https://sourcediving.com/learning-to-boost-query-time-relevance-signal-boosting-cookpad-6af9eb206f38#:~:text=Using%20that%20data%2C%20you%20learn,for%20thousands%20of%20different%20queries)). Their “learning to boost” approach replaced guesswork with data-driven weights. Similarly, Thumbtack’s transition to an ML model made it much easier to add and reweigh features – retraining the model was faster and more consistent than continual manual tuning ([Our Transition to Machine Learning in Search Ranking to Match Customers and Professionals | by Thumbtack Engineering | Thumbtack Engineering | Medium](https://medium.com/thumbtack-engineering/our-transition-to-machine-learning-in-search-ranking-to-match-customers-and-professionals-68fb29e39899#:~:text=slowing%20down%20development,rigorous%20as%20we%20would%20like)) ([Our Transition to Machine Learning in Search Ranking to Match Customers and Professionals | by Thumbtack Engineering | Thumbtack Engineering | Medium](https://medium.com/thumbtack-engineering/our-transition-to-machine-learning-in-search-ranking-to-match-customers-and-professionals-68fb29e39899#:~:text=would%20also%20be%20easier%2C%20since,as%20evaluate%20the%20resulting%20rankers)).

Furthermore, we explored **alternative strategies to avoid manual boosting**: incorporating business signals into training (so the model naturally boosts them), optimizing directly for business KPIs, and applying re-ranking algorithms for global constraints. These strategies shift the focus from one-off boosts to a more holistic optimization of search outcomes. They are increasingly feasible with modern open-source tools and frameworks:

-   **Open source libraries** like **TensorFlow Ranking** and **XGBoost** support custom loss functions and can optimize ranking metrics with weights, enabling multi-objective training.
-   **Elasticsearch Learning-to-Rank plugin** and **Vespa.ai** allow deploying learned models that consider business features, bringing offline training into the online search engine ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=The%20Elasticsearch%20Learning%20to%20Rank,field%20%E2%80%9Cmatch%E2%80%9D%20ranking%20features)) ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=Later%20you%20can%20join%20it,LTR)).
-   **Metarank (open-source)** provides a reranking service that can learn field boosts from user interactions, automating what used to be manual field weight tuning ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=Suppose%20we%20log%20BM25%20per,to%20a%20simple%20regression%20problem)) ([Approaches to field boost tuning with Learning to Rank  - OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/12/16/approaches-to-field-boost-tuning-with-learning-to-rank/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Pairwise%20data)).
-   For global constraints, implementations of **MMR** for diversification are available (e.g., in PyTerrier or as Azure Search options) to easily add diversity re-ranking ([azure-ai-search-maximum-marginal-relevance.ipynb - GitHub](https://github.com/farzad528/azure-ai-search-python-playground/blob/main/azure-ai-search-maximum-marginal-relevance.ipynb#:~:text=azure,improve%20the%20quality%20of)).

In practice, a combination of approaches might yield the best results. You could use a trained model that largely handles relevance and business trade-offs, supplemented by a light touch of online boosting for any hard business requirements not captured in data (with continuous evaluation to ensure those boosts remain needed). The trend, however, is clearly toward **data-driven ranking**: letting the model learn how to trade off dozens of features, rather than maintaining a complex web of manual boosts. This tends to improve not just metrics but agility – new features can be deployed by logging and retraining rather than painstakingly tuning weights one by one ([Our Transition to Machine Learning in Search Ranking to Match Customers and Professionals | by Thumbtack Engineering | Thumbtack Engineering | Medium](https://medium.com/thumbtack-engineering/our-transition-to-machine-learning-in-search-ranking-to-match-customers-and-professionals-68fb29e39899#:~:text=into%20a%20particular%20range%20,and%20then%20multiplied%20them%20together)) ([Our Transition to Machine Learning in Search Ranking to Match Customers and Professionals | by Thumbtack Engineering | Thumbtack Engineering | Medium](https://medium.com/thumbtack-engineering/our-transition-to-machine-learning-in-search-ranking-to-match-customers-and-professionals-68fb29e39899#:~:text=With%20an%20ML,as%20evaluate%20the%20resulting%20rankers)).

To wrap up, teams should aim for approaches that are **simple (to implement and explain), generalizable (work for all queries without per-query hacks), and production-ready (scalable and robust)**. If manual feature boosting is causing maintenance pain or bias concerns, consider investing in an offline learning-to-rank pipeline or advanced re-ranking techniques. These will align your search ranking with both user relevance and business goals in a more principled way, reducing the need for constant manual intervention while delivering better results to end-users.

Ultimately, the less we have to _manually_ tweak and the more we can _train_ or _compute_ optimal tweaks, the more scalable and effective our search systems will be. By following the comparative insights detailed above, the team can progressively evolve their ranking system from a manually boosted model to a smarter, self-tuning one that inherently respects the business-driven priorities.
