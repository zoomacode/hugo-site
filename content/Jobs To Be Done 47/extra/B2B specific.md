    -   showing useful to the potential customer information in advance **3x increases probability of success**
-   personal contact is more important than a product. people perceive familiar people as more reliable so more likely to provide support in the future and so secure the position of a decision maker who buys the product

    -   **insight** -an expensive product can be 8x likely to be bought if it is aligned with the decision maker personal goals
-   you need to understand that is the decision making process and who is involved in the process so you know who else you need to talk to.
    -   also try to understand that are the decision making criteria so you can focus on meeting those criteria
-   types of people in B2B
    -   Decision makers - talk to them first the rest are less important or sometimes irrelevant
    -   Budget holders - they can block the decision
        -   don't hesitate to ask about the budget and make sure you understand the process
    -   Influencers - people inside (or outside) the company who can influence the decision one way or another. Work with then if you can
    -   Recommenders - people who can be asked for their opinion about your product
    -   Saboteurs - people who can be strongly against your product - like a decision maker who bought previous solution
-   talk to decision makers first

### What to take out of a B2B interview

-   jobs and goals both business and personal
-   problems
-   decision making process, people involved and their roles, evaluation criteria

### How to find an decision maker

-   work as a team
-   send some that personalized email like "you were recommended to us by ..."
    -   recommendations from real people work the best
-   ask for people you can talk to
-   bring some value with you
-   LinkedIn is a good place to start
