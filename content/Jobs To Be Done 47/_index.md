This is a collection of my notes I took during a product management crush course
from https://zamesin.ru which I highly recommend as an software engineer who
wanted to understand how to approach development of internal and not so much tools
from the product stand point. The notes have a lot of "To Be Described" sections maybe I will add more content there or maybe will not.
