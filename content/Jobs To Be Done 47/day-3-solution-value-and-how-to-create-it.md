Solution value can be defined as a difference between perceived benefits provided by a solution and perceived costs associated with a solution. In addition to that there can be a perceived cost of switching to the solution. We use "perceived" here since there is usually a gap between reality and perception and value is in the eye of the beholder.

- $value(solution) = benefits(solution) - costs(solution)$ 
- value is relative. It is hard to assign a value number to a solution so people usually compare one vs another.
- main paths to add value:
	- add benefits
	- reduce costs
	- both
	- sometimes it is cost increase but providing much more benefits
- aha-moment or value activation - aha-moment is the moment when the user realizes the value of a solution. For example, for a new expensive car the status value of a car can be activated at the point when you gave a ride to a friend and they said "wow, that was great." For a report, it can be a moment when you receive positive feedback for the quality of the report and not the moment when you generated a report.
#### Top mechanisms to bring more value
1. do an important job nobody else does
2. fix problems in the main job
3. provide base quality for your solution - people expect it as bare minimum
4. eliminate low-level jobs
5. do more jobs within a user using one solution so the user uses your solution more frequently and value it more as a tool
6. move to a different segment with a same solution
7. do the immediate next job after current job - Figma is a good example, current job "create a report", and next job "share report"
8. reduce the cost of a job
9. add more benefits to a job
10. fulfill basic needs: status, safety, social contact etc
11. communicate that a solution fulfills one of the basic needs
12. wake up a sleeping job - higher level jobs which can be completed more efficiently but using a different solution
13. correct expectations - the user may have unreasonable expectations correcting them in advance will reduce disappointment when unreasonable expectations are not met

#### An algorithm for solving business problems with a product
1. clarify and challenge the goal
2. find mechanisms which may help to achieve the goal
3. find raw material to pick right mechanisms: analytics + JTBD interviews
4. apply mechanisms: [Airtable - How to pick value mechanisms](https://airtable.com/appjUxuSKoqSjUEo8/shrZ8UM9jhuaE5kk4)
5. rank mechanisms by [RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/)

##### On RICE
 [RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/) is a mechanisms for ranking different solutions. Confidence can be tricky to estimate you can try to use [Idea Prioritization With ICE and The Confidence Meter](https://itamargilad.com/the-tool-that-will-help-you-choose-better-product-ideas/) for estimations.
