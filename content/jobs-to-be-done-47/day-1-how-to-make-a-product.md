## JTBD: day one - how to make a product

JTBD or Jobs To Be Done is a framework where we focus on the jobs the customer needs to complete in order to achieve something. For example, to complete a _"get some food supplies to stack them up"_ job, the customer may hire a solution "go to a supermarket", or "order only". For a job _"eat something when I'm hungry"_, the customer can hire one of the following jobs: "go to a grocery store and then cook themselves", "order food online", "go to a restaurant", "go a grab street food".

Jobs can be organized as a graph. The job _"eat something when I'm hungry"_ is a higher level in comparison to _"get some food supplies to stack them up"_ which is a part of a solution where the customer first bring food home, and then on that day or a different day they will use those supplies to cook something to eat when they go hungry or they may cook in bulk so they eat pre-cooked food later.

JTBD explores who people interact with reality and tries to make those interactions more cost efficient and/or more valuable.

-   JTBD - it is pure capitalism - exchange of resources (money, time, effort) for customer value
-   People **hire** jobs to fulfill their needs
    -   People lie and do not realize their needs
    -   So don't ask people about the future or what they would need - they will lie or hallucinate
-   Product value is `benefits - cost`
-   You need to think in terms of graph changes and derive features from there
-   Consciousness is a needs consensus protocol which acts like an investors. It looks at the available options and picks the best option in terms of ROI.
    -   The brain do not like to waste resources. Something broken can create a penalty ("taxation") job and the brain perceives as mis-prediction (waste of resources) which needs to be corrected (extra effort and more resources to poor in).
-   Top 3 approaches in JTBD
    1.  fix the problems - problems are value eaters.
    2.  combine multiple jobs - reduces the cost and increases value
    3.  reduce the jobs graph - reduces the cost and increases value
-   Enter the graph as early as you can - it will bump up the value and increase the conversion.
