#### Three insights

1. product strategy is not a kind of magic, it is an algorithm
2. strategy is a path not a destination
3. small daily decision we make is a part of the strategy

**Note:** companies which work outside of market rules do not need a strategy since their decision making process is not market driven. For example, the government.

**The main mistake is the ignorance of current trends.**

> Sandy san,
> Our current success is the best reason to change.
> We must be permanently dissatisfied in order to succeed.

_Eiji Toyoda (CEO of Toyota)_

Product Strategy is answering the question: _what jobs are we going to do in the future at a higher level of the job graph_.

**Product strategy inputs:**

1. JTBD for a segment selection and product selection.
2. Analytics
3. Experts: segments, values
4. Analysis: competence, resources, decision principles.

You can use [OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) loop - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) when you think about a strategy. In OODA you need to spend at least 80% time in observe and orient.

#### Mechanisms

##### 1 - fix a broken job

_This and next two are about similar problems at different scale._

If something just does not work at all there is no way it can be used. Hence there is no value in the solution. Fix it.

##### 2 - fix problems in a job

Broken processes, and paper-cuts eat the product value like a pack of wolfs who found a deer after a week of hunger. This is the next thing you need to fix in your product.

##### 3 - provide base/minimal quality

You need to provide some minimal quality to make you product work. Everything should just work and do not fall apart. It does not have to be good. It has to be acceptable.

##### 4 - eliminate lower level jobs

For example, to select a personal WiFi hotspot on Mac.

-   Before: take a phone, open the settings menu, enable a hotspot, open wifi settings on a laptop, enter password
-   After: select your phone in a drop down menu

##### 5 - do more jobs of a customer using one solution

#tbd

##### 6 - do next job

For example, create a report then share it

##### 7 - reduce a job costs without changing the graph

#tbd

##### 8 - increase a job benefits

#tbd

##### 9 - fulfill basic needs

#tbd

##### 10 - communicate that your solution fulfills basic needs

#tbd

##### 11 - correct expectations

#tbd

##### 12 - wake up sleeping jobs

#tbd

##### 13 - reduce onboarding costs

#tbd

##### 14 - gray area: increase costs of switching a competing product (vendor lock)

#tbd

##### 15 - gray area: increase benefits when a customer tries to switch to a competing product

#tbd

##### 16 - dark pattern: block customers from switching to a competing product

For example, impossible to disable a subscribtion
#tbd

##### 17 - dark pattern: you want one thing, we give you something else

#tbd

##### 18 - gray area: only we can do this job

#tbd

##### 19 - go to a previous job

This may give you 2x
#tbd

##### 20 - go to a higher level job

This can give 10x growth.
#tbd

##### 21 - Do a low-level job used in many other graphs

#tbd

##### 22 - Shift to a different segment

This approach allows to extend a market segment or move away from a direct competition.

##### 23 - Shift to a segment which is ready to pay 10x

This approach allows to extend a market segment or move away from a direct competition.

If you have 10 customers who pay for your product there is at least one who will pay 10x. Repeat for every next 10x paying customers.

##### 24 - Move to low-cost or to premium

This approach allows to extend a market segment or move away from a direct competition.

Mid-price segment is the most competitive segment moving to a different price-range may require different skills and competencies.

##### 25 - B2B to B2C and vise versa

This approach allows to extend a market segment or move away from a direct competition.

##### 26 - SuperApp: a distribution channel

SuperApp is a distribution channel that allow to generate leads for a lower price than through other channels. A shopping mall is an example of a superapp.

##### 27 - Tripwire: lead generation

offer a disproportionally higher perceived value so it will be really hard to discard an offer by the lead. For example, a nice fatty juicy burger for $0.99 or freemium products.

##### 28 - Build an eco-system

Sum of individual not connected product is less than a sum of connected products. Also eco-systems allows to build products otherwise not possible and eliminate jobs which wouldn't possible or much harder to eliminate outside of an eco-system. Look at Apple with synchronizations, Apple cash, continuity etc.

##### 29 - Focus on vital jobs

#tbd

##### 30 - Select a segment with a largest pain

#tbd

##### 31 - Select the largest most frequent important but underserved segment

#tbd

##### 32 - Select a segment which defines an opinion in other segments

#tbd

##### 33 - don't choose an easy to reproduce job by a large player and activate it in their customer

> Unfortunately, we've decided not to fund AskGuru this batch. We thought you built a pretty cool looking product. The UX you've created is one of the most well-done we've seen in this area, and we have seen a LOT of customer support Al tools recently. The problem is, enterprise software doesn't win because it has great polished UX, it wins because it:

Their implementation might not be as polished, but no one is buying a second product just for polish. And the segment of customers left after the top 3 customer support platforms are taken away is just not very big, which we think you agree with. We don't agree that expanding into libraries and other

##### 34 - for B2B - choose a segment with a shortest feedback loop

##### 35 -wait
