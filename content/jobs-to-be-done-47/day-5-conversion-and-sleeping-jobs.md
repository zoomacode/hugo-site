### What does the customer purchase depend on

#### Switching to a new solution or Four forces of progress

| Holding back | Pushing forward                | Difficult to change |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| barriers     | perceived value                | easier              |
| habits       | issues in the current solution | harder              |

**Barriers and perceived value** are easier to change - we can fix issues, reduce barriers, add value, explain the value etc. **Habits and issues in current solution** are harder to influence. Habits are hardwired into people's brains and the brain doesn't like energy demanding changes. We also have no control over the issues in current solution but we can highlight them in our communication to increase perceived value.

We also need to keep in mind that these forces are only active in certain situations. People usually do not explore other options.

Why **habits** are difficult to change? When the brain learns a habit it builds an energy efficient circuit which the brain then uses to run a habit. However, the process of building that circuit is energy consuming and since the brain avoids energy consuming activities it will try to stop the lead from forming a new habit.

What can we do to change a habit?

-   avoid introduction of a new habit
-   reuse an old habit
-   evolve your product gradually
    Familiar interfaces, and processes instead of completely new UX can make the lead be more willing to accept a new product.

#### Value activation

For sequential jobs the value becomes available in the end of a chain. It can be a problem since the user invest their resources **in a hope** that they will receive at some point. To address the issue you can try:

-   rework the workflow to provide value earlier or in chunks
-   alternatively you can keep reminding about the value they will receive
-   reduce costs of onboarding
-   go up in the graph or eliminate jobs at current and lower levels.

#### Sleeping jobs

Sleeping jobs are jobs which can be activated by switching to other maybe unusual solution. For example, starting investing in bonds instead of using a savings account after realizing that bonds can be a better option. The knowledge that bonds exist and can be easily bought is activation knowledge.

##### Sleeping job activation conditions

1. know your segment: know activation factors, presence of a higher level job
2. upload activation knowledge into the lead's head: knowledge of ability to complete the job, knowledge about an available solution.
