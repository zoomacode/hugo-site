Choosing a segment is one of the most important decisions. It will define the results you can achieve.

**We can't build a product for everyone.**

A free interpretation of from [Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance: Porter, Michael E.: 9780684841465: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Advantage-Creating-Sustaining-Performance/dp/0684841460)

> Our goal is to become the best in a specific, and maybe in initially narrow segment, through precise knowledge of the jobs in the segment and implementation of a significantly better solution that competing solutions.

So the goal of a segment selection is to find a segment with maximum ROI and minimum opportunity costs.

#### The process

##### 1. Hypothesis

-   Worse. "I have a great idea and 100% believe in it" - Affected by the confirmation bias, narrow view, and hallucinations.
    -   write hypothesis, validate it in JTBD interview
    -   drop the initial idea
-   Better. "I have a rough idea but I'm not sure about the competitors and I want to test it" - these are good as well since they test their assumptions.
    -   test a hypothesis for a higher-level job
    -   focus on understanding of what kind of people you want to talk to
-   Best. "I don't have an idea but I want to find a segment". It is a super discovery mode. Talk to the experts.

#### Insights JTBD for a segment

1. assume that you don't know the real jobs
2. use MVP only if it is extremely cheap to produce
3. Growth points are hidden outside of current jobs
4. Recruit respondents how "paid" for a solution
5. use 6-8 interviews per iteration
6. use multiple channels to source the respondents to avoid selection bias
