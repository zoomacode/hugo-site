Hi, I'm Anton and I'm a software engineer. Mostly self taught. I'm a bit chaotic in my hobbies
today I do a lot of film photography, tomorrow I'm trying to figure out how to design simple 3D models
in Fusion 360. From time to time I have that etching need to write something down and this the place
I'm scratching that need.

Besides that I love the idea of open information and don't really like paywalls so I put everything
